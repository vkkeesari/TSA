            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h2>How Our Story Began</h2>
            <p>Ahara is derived from the Sanskrit word food. Ahara is more than just an Indian restaurant, it's a celebration of India’s rich culinary heritage, crafted especially for those who prefer vegan and vegetarian lifestyles. We take pride in offering a menu that stays true to traditional Indian flavors while being entirely plant-forward, ensuring that every dish is authentic and thoughtfully prepared. At Ahara, we source the freshest, high-quality ingredients to create meals that are vibrant, nourishing, and full of depth. Our carefully curated menu highlights the diversity of Indian cuisine, from comforting street food to wholesome, home-style meals, all prepared with a commitment to sustainability and health-conscious dining. 
</p>
            <h2>Our Mission<h2>
            <p>
                At Ahara, we do more than serve food—we bring India’s rich heritage, culture, and traditions to life through every dish. Our menu reflects the diverse culinary landscape of India, showcasing recipes passed down through generations, each infused with history and tradition. Indian cuisine is a form of art, where vibrant spices, aromatic herbs, and time-honored cooking techniques come together to create bold, complex flavors. Spices are at the heart of this experience—not just for taste but for their cultural and medicinal significance. From turmeric's healing warmth to cumin's earthy depth, each spice tells a story.
